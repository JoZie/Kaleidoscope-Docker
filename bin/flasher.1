.SH "NAME"
\fBbin/flasher\fR \- Kaleidoscope firmware flasher tool

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbin/flasher\fR \fIBOARD\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBbin/flasher\fR is a small tool to aid in flashing a firmware already compiled
by \fBbin/builder\fR(1). It currently relies on using the default output
directory of that tool.

The flashing is done using tools shipped with the Docker image, and coped into
the output directory. They may have shared library dependencies that the host
needs installed. These would be \fIlibftdi\fR, \fIlibusb\fR, \fIreadline\fR, and
\fIncurses\fR.

.SH "OPTIONS"
The only argument the tool accepts is the name of the board, which determines
how flashing should be done. The following boards are supported:

.TP
\fBModel01\fR
The Keyboardio Model01, flashed with \fIavrdude\fR.

.TP
\fBErgoDox\fR
The original ErgoDox, or an ErgoDox EZ, or anything else that is wired the same, and uses a Teensy. Flashed with \fIteensy_loader_cli\fR.
